8-1 Introduction to TV Technology
Television is a system of sending and receiving pictures and sound by means of electronic signals transmitted through wires and optical fibers or by electromagnetic radiation. These signals are usually broadcast from a central source, a television station, to reception devices such as television sets in homes or relay stations such as those used by cable television service providers. Television is the most widespread form of communication in the world. Though most people will never meet the leader of a country, travel to the moon, or participate in a war, they can observe these experiences through the images on their television.
Television has a variety of applications in society, business, and science. The most common use of television is as a source of information and entertainment for viewers in their homes. Security personnel also use televisions to monitor buildings, manufacturing plants, and numerous public facilities. Public utility employees use television to monitor the condition of an underground sewer line, using a camera attached to a robot arm or remote-control vehicle. Doctors can probe the interior of a human body with a microscopic television camera without having to conduct major surgery on the patient. Educators use television to reach students throughout the world.
People in the United States have the most television sets per person of any country, with 814 sets per 1000 people in 1994. More than 98 percent of households in the United States have television sets. Canada, Japan, Germany, Denmark, and Finland follow the United States in the number of sets per person.
How television works
A television program is created by focusing a television camera on a scene. The camera changes light from the scene into an electric signal, called the video signal, which varies depending on the strength, or brightness, of light received from each part of the scene. In color television, the camera produces an electric signal that varies depending on the strength of each color of light.
Three or four cameras are typically used to produce a television program. The video signals from the cameras are processed in a control room, then combined with video signals from other cameras and sources, such as videotape recorders, to provide the variety of images and special effects seen during a television program.
Audio signals from microphones placed in or near the scene also flow to the control room, where they are amplified and combined. Except in the case of live broadcasts (such as news and sports programs) the video and audio signals are recorded on tape and edited, assembled with the use of computers into the final program, and broadcast later. In a typical television station, the signals from live and recorded features, including commercials, are put together in a master control room to provide the station's continuous broadcast schedule. Throughout the broadcast day, computers start and stop videotape machines and other program sources, and switch the various audio and visual signals. The signals are then sent to the transmitter.
The transmitter amplifies the video and audio signals, and uses the electronic signals to modulate, or vary, carder waves (oscillating electric currents that carry information). The carrier waves are combined (diplexed), then sent to the transmitting antenna, usually placed on the tallest available structure in a given broadcast area. In the antenna, the oscillations of the carrier waves generate electromagnetic waves of energy that radiate horizontally throughout the atmosphere. The waves excite weak electric currents in all television-receiving antennas within range. These currents have the characteristics of the original picture and sound currents. The currents flow from the antenna attached to the television into the television receiver, where they are electronically separated into audio and video signals. These signals are amplified and sent to the picture tube and the speakers, where they produce the picture and sound portions of the program.

1. The Television Camera
The television camera is the first tool used to produce a television program. Most cameras have three basic elements: an optical system for capturing an image, a pickup device for translating the image into electronic signals, and an encoder for encoding signals so they may be transmitted.
(1) Optical System
The optical system of a television camera includes a fixed lens that is used to focus the scene onto the front of the pickup device. Color cameras also have a system of prisms and mirrors that separate incoming light from a scene into the three primary colors: red, green, and blue. Each beam of light is then directed to its own pickup device. Almost any color can be reproduced by combining these colors in the appropriate proportions. Most inexpensive consumer video cameras use a filter that breaks light from an image into the three primary colors.
(2) Pickup Device
The pickup device takes light from a scene and translates it into electronic signals. The first pickup devices used in cameras were camera tubes. The first camera tube used in television was the iconoscope. Invented in the 1920s, it needed a great deal of light to produce a signal, so it was impractical to use in a low-light setting, such as an outdoor evening scene. The image-orthicon tube and the vidicon tube were invented in the 1940s and were a vast improvement on the iconoscope. They needed only about as much light to record a scene as human eyes need to see. Instead of camera tubes, most modem cameras now use light-sensitive integrated circuits (tiny, electronic devices) called charge-coupled devices (CCDs).
When recording television images, the pickup device replaces the function of film used in making movies. In a camera tube pickup device, the front of the tube contains a layer of photosensitive material called a target. In the image-orthicon tube, the target material is photoemissive, that is, it emits electrons when it is struck by light. In the vidicon camera tube, the target material is photoconductive, that is, it conducts electricity when it is struck by light. In both cases, the lens of a camera focuses light from a scene onto the front of the camera tube, and this light causes changes in the target material. The light image is transformed into an electronic image, which can then be read from the back of the target by a beam of electrons (tiny, negatively charged particles).
The beam of electrons is produced by an electron gun at the back of the camera tube. The beam is controlled by a system of electromagnets that make the beam systematically scan the target material. Whenever the electron beam hits the bright parts of the electronic image on the target material, the tube emits a nigh voltage, and when the beam nits a dark part of the image, the tube emits a low voltage. This varying voltage is the electronic television signal.
A charge-coupled device (CCD) can be much smaller than a camera tube and is much more durable. As a result, cameras with CCDs are more compact and portable than those using a camera tube. The image they create is less vulnerable to distortion and is therefore clearer. In a CCD, the light from a scene strikes an array of photodiodes arranged on a silicon chip. Photodiodes are devices that conduct electricity when they are struck by light, they send this electricity to tiny capacitors. The capacitors store the electrical charge, with the amount of charge stored depending on the strength of the light that struck the photodiode. The CCD converts the incoming light from the scene into an electrical signal by releasing the charges from the photodiodes in an order that follows the scanning pattern that the receiver will follow in re-creating the image.
 (3) Encoder
In color television, the signals from the three camera tubes or charge-coupled devices are first amplified, then sent to the encoder before leaving the camera. The encoder combines the three signals into a single electronic signal that contains the brightness information of the colors (luminance). It then adds another signal that contains the code used to combine the colors (color burst), and the synchronization information used to direct the television receiver to follow the same scanning pattern as the camera. The color television receiver uses the color burst part of the signal to separate the three colors again.
2. Scanning
Television cameras and television receivers use a procedure called scanning to record visual images and recreate them on a television screen. The television camera records an image, such as a scene in a television show, by breaking it up into a series of lines and scanning over each line with the beam or beams of electrons contained in the camera tube. The pattern is created in a CCD camera by the array of photodiodes. One scan of an image produces one static picture, like a single frame in a film. The camera must scan a scene many times per second to record a continuous image. In the television receiver, another electron beam--or set of electron beams, in the case of color television--uses the signals recorded by the camera to reproduce the original image on the receiver's screen. Just like the beam or beams in the camera, the electron beam in the receiver must scan the screen many times per second to reproduce a continuous image.
In order for television to work, television images must be scanned and recorded in the same manner as television receivers reproduce them. In the United States, broadcasters and television manufacturers have agreed on a standard of breaking images down into 525 horizontal lines, and scanning images 30 times per second. In Europe, most of Asia, and Australia, images are broken down into 625 lines, and they are scanned 25 times per second. Special equipment can be used to make television images that have been recorded in one standard fit a television system that uses a different standard. Telecine equipment (from the words television and cinema) is used to convert film and slide images to television signals. The images from film projectors or slides are directed by a system of mirrors toward the telecine camera, which records the images as video signals.
The scanning method that is most commonly used today is called interlaced scanning. It produces a clear picture that does not fade or flicker. When an image is scanned line by line from top to bottom, the top of the image on the screen will begin to fade by the time the electron beam reaches the bottom of the screen. With interlaced scanning, odd-numbered lines are scanned first, and the remaining even-numbered lines are scanned next. A full image is still produced 30 times a second; but the electron beam travels from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen twice for every time a full image is produced.
